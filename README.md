# SIRIO

Sirio (SImulator of Radio Interferometic Observations) is an  IDL package to practice with the logic of radio imaging
First developed in ~2012 by F. Vazza & A. Bonafede @Uni Hamburg as a tool to practice with the principles of radio imaging with simple IDL routines. 
It is not meant for real production of mock radio observations, but to illustrate all most important steps in radio imaging, giving qualitatively correct answer.
SIRIO includes (not in order of appearance):
- reading of 2D sky model (single frequency);
- creation of UV coverage of a given antenna dataset;
- beam formation and visibilities;
- formation of the "dirty" image;
- thermal noise contribution;
- baseline interpolation;
- cleaning by iterations.
Enjoy!
